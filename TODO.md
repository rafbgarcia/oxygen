MVP Roadmap:

- Operations between fields
- Filters
- Scheduled build
- Support multiple tables within a Dataset

Tech debt:

- Index build info and rename columns on pandas to support "%"
- Use GraphQL - https://docs.graphene-python.org/projects/django/en/latest/tutorial-plain/
- Use Celery worker to build datasets
- Preview is slow for a large number of records. Is there a way to limit it?
